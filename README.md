# CB_3D
3D model of the school.

To view the model, download AtriumAtlasY.obj, AtriumAtlasY.mtl, and all images in the Textures folder. You should then be able to open and view the .obj file.

The original / raw textures are in Textures.zip.

Download one of the .blend files (and Textures.zip) to edit in Blender. If the textures don't show up you might need to use File > External Data > Find Missing Files and navigate to the textures folder.
