# CB 3D
Model of the school created by the 3D Enthusiasts' club.

To view the current model, download the files and open the **Atrium8.obj** file.

You can open the .blend files with Blender (the latest version is "Atrium8.blend" in the *Releases*). If the textures don't show up you might need to use `File -> External Data -> Find Missing Files` and navigate to the textures folder.

A comparison with real life and another view of the model.
