# CB_3D
3D model of the school.

To view the model, download Atrium4.obj, Atrium4.mtl, and Textures.zip. Then unzip the zip so that the textures are in the exact same folder as the .obj and .mtl. You should then be able to open and view the .obj file.

Download the .blend file (and Textures.zip) to edit in Blender. If the textures don't show up you might need to use File > External Data > Find Missing Files and navigate to the textures folder.
